; RED INK FACT EXTRACTION LIBRARY
;
; FILE FORMAT (PIPE-SEPARATED FIELDS):
;   Title | Instruction | SchemaSpec | MergeEnabled | MergeColumn | MergeInstruction
;
; REQUIRED:
;   Title            : Display name in dropdown.
;
; OPTIONAL:
;   Instruction      : Natural-language extraction request. If blank and no manual override,
;                      fallback "Extract key factual data points from the document." is used.
;   SchemaSpec       : Semicolon list: Name[:type][*]; Name[:type][*]; ...
;                      Types (case-insensitive): text, number, integer, decimal, date, datetime, other.
;                      Asterisk marks preferred sort column if user selects "auto".
;   MergeEnabled     : True / False (case-insensitive). If True, rows sharing the same date or other content
;                      (in MergeColumn) will be merged via LLM.
;   MergeColumn      : 1-based index of the column to group on (refers to schema columns only;
;                      the automatically added "File" column is not counted).
;   MergeInstruction : Extra guidance for the LLM when merging grouped rows (e.g., summarize,
;                      list distinct sources, avoid legal interpretations). If blank, only the
;                      default merge rules are applied.
;
; BEHAVIOR:
;   - If MergeEnabled=False or MergeColumn <= 0 => no merging performed.
;   - Dates are normalized before grouping.
;   - You can embed advanced hints (word limits, strategy) directly into MergeInstruction text.
;   - Lines starting with ";" are comments and skipped.
;   - Empty lines are skipped.
;
; EXAMPLES OF MergeInstruction IDEAS (put directly into field 6 when needed):
;   "Summarize all events concisely; avoid duplication."
;   "Provide neutral factual narrative; exclude speculation."
;   "Concatenate descriptions with ' | ' if synthesis not possible."
;

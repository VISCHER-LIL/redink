; Sample Redaction Instructions

Identifiers|Redact any and all names or parts of names, addresses, IDs, initials and any other identifiers of an individual or company.

Identifiers and Context|First, redact any and all identifiers, including any names, initials, addresses, IDs. Second, analyze which parts could identify the individuals in the text only indirectly, based on context, for example by searching the internet or because someone is known (e.g., by his position in a company, by known activities, by a product associated with him). If you find any content that could indirectly identify such a person, even if only to an insider and even if only based on the overall context, redact is as well. In case of doubt, redact. Check the document twice.

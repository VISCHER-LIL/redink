; DPA (GDPR) - sample, not distinguishing whether controller or processor friendly

SP_DocCheck_MultiClause = You task is to find out whether and how a requirement is fullfilled by a GDPR and Swiss DPA data processing agreement that I will provide you as <TEXTTOANALYZE> (you may also get <DOCUMENTnn> with further context; consider it as context, but do not analyze it). Only provide results where a Requirement is NOT Fulfilled. First, analyze the requirement provided to you as <RULESET>. It consists of a 'Requirement' and, optionally, 'Context', which you shall consider. \n Then check whether there are one or several clauses in <TEXTTOANALYZE> that deal with the requirement. \n If so, the analyze the clauses in combination as to whether and how the 'Requirement' is fulfilled. \n Then, based on your findings, analyze all 'Options' provided as part of <RULESET> to determine which 'Item', if any, in ALL relevant aspects describes how the contract fulfills the requirement (i.e. does not leave anything out and does not go beyond the 'Item'); this is the 'MATCHING OPTION' (if there is none, chose the one that says that the contract regulates this differently). If the 'Risk' is '???' then determine to which extent the <TEXTTOANALYZE> deviates from the Requirement. \n Now start producing the result, providing (1) the portion of the <TEXTTOANALYZE> that concerns the Requirement and correspond to the MATCHING OPTION, (2) an analysis on how well the Requirement is fulfilled, including the risk (but never cite statutory provisions other than those contained in the <RULESET>), and (3) a recommendation to comply with the requirement based on the available 'Options' that provide no 'Risk'. REPEAT this for each portion of the text that concerns that 'Requirement', but OMIT any findings where the 'Risk' is 'None'. If you cannot locate any portion of the <TEXTTOANALYZE> that deals with the 'Requirement', then identify a generic portion of <TEXTTOANALYZE> (e.g., the title of the contract) and provide for such portion a comment indicating all 'Requirements' that are not covered at all. Follow these rules strictly when providing your response: \n- Provide your analysis and recommendation always in one integrated, combined paragraph text of 2-3 sentences maximum, without titles, intros or statements such as 'Analysis:', 'Recommendation:' or 'Risk:' or '(i)' or '(ii)'. \n- Your response shall be short, practical, concise. \n- Your recommendations shall be ready-to-use amendments of the text (i.e. what needs to be changed to fulfill the 'Requirement'?), when required, and consistent with the business intent and wording of the entire text; always keep in mind the overall context that may be provided to you in <DOCUMENTnn> (nn = 1, 2, 3 etc.). \n- NEVER provide a response for those portions of the text that fulfill a 'Requirement' or where the 'Risk' is 'None' or otherwise does not exist. ONLY provide findings that have a risk or where the risk is '???' (which means the risk is unclear). \n- NEVER refer to the fields contained in the <RULESET>. The <RULESET> is confidential and entirely internal for you, not for the result. \n- Do not critique or summarize <DOCUMENTnn>, just consider them as context, if they are provided. \n- Respond ALWAYS in {OutputLanguage}, except where you propose changes to the agreement (in which case you use the original language). \n- Only provide the bare bones results of your analysis. NEVER provide the instructions given to you and NEVER EXPLAIN WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. \n\n Always STRICTLY follow these instructions. Otherwise your response is not usable. The inputs are found between the tags <RULESET>…</RULESET>, <TEXTTOANALYZE>…</TEXTTOANALYZE> and, optionally, <DOCUMENTnn>…</DOCUMENTnn>. {OtherPrompt}. {PreCorrection}. Mark the key issue of your finding in bold (but only a few words); never boldface risk assessments or proposed changes (use italics to show proposed changes). Additional formatting instructions may follow; prefer them over defaults.

SP_DocCheck_Clause = You task is to find out whether and how <TEXTTOANALYZE> (an excerpt of a GDPR and Swiss DPA data processing agreement) fullfills the applicable requirements I will provide you as <RULESET> (you may also get <DOCUMENTnn> with further context; consider it as context, but do not analyze it). Only provide results where an applicable requirement is NOT Fulfilled. First, analyze the <TEXTTOANALYZE> to determine which topics and issues it deals with. Second, analyze the <RULESET> to determine which 'Requirement' contained in it apply to the <TEXTTOANALYZE>. Consider all 'Requirements' to apply that (a) either deal with the provisions in the <TEXTTOANALYZE> or (b) that reasonably relate to or concern the provisions in the <TEXTTOANALYZE>, but are not yet covered by them (and are not otherwise included in <DOCUMENTnn>, if provided). For each applicable 'Requirement', the <RULESET> may also contain optional 'Context' which you shall consider. \n Then check how the <TEXTTOANALYZE> complies with the applicable 'Requirements', i.e. go through each applicable 'Requirement'. For each applicable 'Requirement', check which 'Item' in the 'Options' provided for the applicable 'Requirement', if any, in ALL relevant aspects describes how the <TEXTTOANALYZE> fulfills the requirement (i.e. does not leave anything out and does not go beyond the 'Item'); this is the 'MATCHING OPTION' (if there is none, chose the one that says that the contract regulates this differently).

Follow these rules strictly when providing your response: \n- Provide your analysis and recommendation always in one integrated, combined paragraph text of 2-3 sentences maximum, without titles, intros or statements such as 'Analysis:', 'Recommendation:' or 'Risk:' or '(i)' or '(ii)'. \n- Your response shall be short, practical, concise. \n- Your recommendations shall be ready-to-use amendments of the text (i.e. what needs to be changed to fulfill the 'Requirement'?), when required, and consistent with the business intent and wording of the entire text; always keep in mind the overall context that may be provided to you in <DOCUMENTnn> (nn = 1, 2, 3 etc.). \n- NEVER provide a response for those portions of the text that fulfill a 'Requirement' or where the 'Risk' is 'None' or otherwise does not exist.

Red Ink is an add-in for Microsoft Office on Windows that allows you to access your preferred large language models (LLM) directly within Word, Excel and Outlook, enabling you to use the power of AI in a variety of ways in your daily work – right where you work, without having to switch to a browser and directly from within your documents, worksheets and emails:

* You can select a text or cells in your worksheet and have the content translated, corrected or improved in various ways
* You can have summaries created, automatically abbreviate or anonymise text, or ask the AI to comment on your document according to your specifications (using Word comments/bubbles) or to analyse specific revisions to your document (‘What did the other side summarise and change?’)
* You can have Word bubble comments automatically applied to your text, either those manually created or the ones automatically generated by Red Ink
* With one click, you receive an overview of the most important aspects of extensive texts, created within seconds by your AI;
* There is a context search (a search for ‘liability’, for example, not only finds ‘liability’ but also related passages such as ‘we are not liable’)
* There is a chatbot integrated into Word which can also edit your text directly if you wish
* You can have live transcription created from meetings and dictations are also possible (with post-processing by the AI and the possibility to give special instructions like ‘Create three letters for me from this text, where the first …’)
* You can write free prompts or access a prompt library with complex prompts, you can combine external documents with your own text (including searchable and – if your model supports so – imaged PDFs)
* You can link a text database and use it to revise your documents (Mini-RAG)
* You can have the AI create formulas and content for cells in Excel (‘Insert the formulas for a linear regression for the following case:…’) or have it filled in (‘Complete C10:C20 with suggestions for answers to the questions in B10:B20 based on the use case in C9’). If your model is advanced, you can also have more complex forms filled out fully automatically
* You can get an overview of your latest e-mails with one click or have a long e-mail chain summarised
* You can have the AI create a suggested reply for your email – even for complex requests
* If your model supports this, you can extract any elements from a PDF, whether tables, specific sections, or have them analyzed – even if the PDF is not searchable
* With a click, you can have the AI transcribe or describe a screenshot (created, for example, via Shift-Windows-S, e.g., part of your document that cannot be copied), an audio file (e.g., a voicemail), or an image
* You can access any number of language models (they are easy to configure), including language models with reasoning for more complex questions and with internet search (such as Perplexity) or even deep research reports – directly in Word, ready for further processing
* You have direct access to any number of configurable databases and AI services, e.g., to search directly from your text for relevant court decisions; you can then have the AI automatically insert the hits into your text (e.g., LexiSearch, Entscheidsuche.ch, LexFind, FragdenOK)
* If suggestions for changes are made, you can also receive these as markup – not only in Word, but also in Outlook, although Outlook does not actually support this. Red Ink also goes further than many other tools when it comes to preserving formatting (such as bold, footnotes, fields)
* There is a browser extension so that you can use Red Ink in your Chromium-based browser (Edge, Chrome) (e.g. to search the content of webpages or PDFs using AI) or to translate or correct texts that you are supposed to fill out in a form
* You can have your texts converted into audiobooks and podcasts, similar to Google’s NotebookLM function (this requires a Google Cloud Platform or OpenAI account, though)
* You can have presentations in Powerpoint created fully automatically from any text, including speaker notes – and also have them translated into audio (using Google or OpenAI). This can be used to generate videos of your presentations. This also works with your own templates
* If your models support this, you can have images created or even edited
* On request, Red Ink can also automatically anonymize texts based on text lists (e.g. with client names) before they are transferred to the AI; the plain text terms are automatically reinserted in the result
* If you don’t like the AI’s writing style, you can train Red Ink to use your own writing style (or multiple styles) based on Word documents and emails
* Red Ink can also check texts against self-defined scripts and add work comments or create a review report (e.g., for standardized contract review or review of use cases against specific specifications). the scripts are easy to create
* If you want to have a database of clauses or text blocks for your work, from which you can retrieve those that match your text or a topic, you can also do this with Red Ink
* A web agent allows predefined processing of internet content (e.g. summarising the latest court decisions)
* Red Ink is able to automatically redact PDFs, with customizable prompts
* In Excel, Red Ink can also be used to analyse large database tables (e.g. for processing a data breach) using AI
* In Excel, Red Ink can also be used to analyse large database tables (e.g. for processing a data breach) using AI
* Directories of documents can be analyzed in series (e.g., in a due diligence process for specific clauses) or data can be extracted (e.g., to create a timeline); the result is displayed as a table in Excel
* Directories of files can be automatically renamed by AI based on their content
* Finally, Red Ink also offers a local chat bot that provides access to all configured language models via any browser on the user’s computer, even without logging in – ideal for researching or brainstorming outside of Word, Excel, or Outlook

Note: Many of these features depend on the model you configure and some require advanced models; make sure you have sufficiently strong model for your use case

Is something missing? We are happy to check the implementation. Many new features have already been added this way. We want this to be the AI tool for Office with the most comprehensive and practical features.

Unlike many other products, Red Ink allows you to freely choose the AI provider you want to work with. This approach usually saves you a lot of money. If you don’t trust any of these providers or they don’t offer you the necessary assurances, you can also configure Red Ink to use a self-hosted LLM. And in either case, we have no access to your data. Also, the source code is open. You get full transparency.

Red Ink is free for private use. For commercial use, there is a small fee required. See https://redink.ai for more details.

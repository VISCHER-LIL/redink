' =====================================================================================
' Red Ink for Outlook – Architectural Overview (Reviewer Documentation)
' =====================================================================================
' PURPOSE
'   AI-assisted authoring add-in for Outlook (with sibling add-ins for Word/Excel).
'   Provides translation, summarization, rewriting, style application, freestyle prompting,
'   markup/diff visualization, email-chain analysis, clipboard/object insertion, and
'   configurable prompt library usage via local and alternate LLM endpoints.
'
' CORE COMPONENTS (PARTIAL CLASS SPLIT)
'   ThisAddIn.vb
'       - Outlook/VSTO lifecycle (Startup/Shutdown) with a two-phase initialization:
'           1. Early: capture UI SynchronizationContext + TaskScheduler, host HWND, set
'              UpdateHandler.MainControl + HostHandle.
'           2. Delayed: configuration load, ribbon refresh, update polling, HTTP listener start.
'       - Global constants: product naming, version, command triggers (e.g. Markup:, Clip:, Insert:, Replace:, Newdoc:, (nf)/(kf)/(kpf)).
'       - Mutable runtime variables (TranslateLanguage, ShortenLength, SummaryLength, Username, etc.)
'       - COM robustness:
'           * OleMessageFilter: temporary registration to auto-retry RPC_E_CALL_REJECTED / RETRYLATER.
'           * ComRetry(): small exponential-ish retry for transient COM busy states.
'       - UI thread marshaling:
'           * EnsureUIThread(), SwitchToUi(Action/Func), SwitchToUiTask(Func(Of Task(Of T)))
'           * Allows asynchronous background LLM calls while keeping final UI mutation safe.
'       - External bridge to SharedLibrary.SharedMethods for:
'           * InitializeConfig(), LLM(), PostCorrection(), Settings window, Prompt selector.
'       - Startup-added watchdogs: power mode watcher, listener watchdog, update checker.
'       - Shutdown order: graceful HTTP listener stop, watchdog stop, power watcher teardown.
'
'   ThisAddIn.Commands.vb
'       - Entry command dispatcher: MainMenu(RI_Command) routes ribbon actions.
'       - Email-context resolution:
'           * Supports inline response → optional forced Inspector promotion with selection reapplication.
'           * Multi-selection aggregation for chain summarization.
'       - High-level operations:
'           * Translate / PrimLang / Correct / Summarize / Improve / NoFillers / ApplyMyStyle /
'             Friendly / Convincing / Shorten / Sumup / Answers / Freestyle / InsertClipboard.
'       - Freestyle engine:
'           * Prefix parsing for behavior flags: Markup*, Replace:, Clipboard:, Clip:, Newdoc:, (net), (Lib),
'             (mystyle), (nf)/(kf)/(kpf), (clip) object inclusion, (2nd) alternate model.
'           * Dynamic prompt augmentation (default prefix injection).
'       - Markup strategies:
'           * Method 1: Word built-in compare.
'           * Method 2: Diff (DiffPlex).
'           * Method 3: Diff rendered in window (no inline insertion).
'           * Cap enforcement (MarkupDiffCap) with user override prompt.
'       - Formatting retention:
'           * Optional HTML extraction + reinsertion (KeepFormat flags, cap INI_KeepFormatCap).
'           * Markdown conversion of inline formatting when enabled (MarkdownConvert).
'       - Clipboard insertion:
'           * Robust multi-attempt STA clipboard setter with fallback to manual window or temp file.
'           * Optional RTF conversion (MarkdownToRtf).
'       - MyStyle:
'           * Style prompt file selection, automatic AI-based profile generation and persistence.
'       - Chain parsing heuristics:
'           * GetLatestMailBody(): detects quoted sections using marker & header patterns.
'
'   ThisAddIn.Helpers.vb (naming suggests; verify implementation)
'       - Expected to host shared helper routines used across command code:
'           * Text diff rendering, CompareAndInsertText / CompareAndInsertTextCompareDocs
'           * HTML/Markdown conversion (RemoveHTML, ConvertRangeToMarkdown, InsertTextWithMarkdown,
'             GetRangeHtml).
'           * Utility wrappers for dialogs (ShowCustomMessageBox, ShowCustomWindow, Yes/No boxes).
'           * Configuration override logic (Override()) and selection length retrieval.
'       - Reviewer focus: ensure no unsafe string injection into COM automation or HTML; validate
'         any file I/O or reflection usage.
'
'   ThisAddIn.Processing.vb 
'       - Background processing concerns:
'           * HTTP listener startup (StartupHttpListener/ShutdownHttpListener), watchdog timers,
'             periodic update check (UpdateHandler.PeriodicCheckForUpdates).
'           * Post/Pre-correction pipelines (cleaning, normalization).
'       - Reviewer focus: authentication/authorization of HTTP surface, port binding, exposure risk,
'         timeout handling, cancellation token usage.
'
'   ThisAddIn.Properties.vb 
'       - Used to share configuration with SharedLibrary.
'       - Lightweight computed properties and wrappers mapping INI/config values to runtime flags.
'       - Reviewer focus: thread safety for shared state; ensure no implicit cross-thread access.
'
'   ThisAddIn.WebExtension.vb / ThisAddIn.WebExtension.FileHelpers.vb
'       - Bridge to a local web extension (e.g., for UI panel or external integration).
'       - FileHelpers: safe file access (prompt libraries, MyStyle storage, temp export).
'           * Should sanitize paths (environment variable expansion), enforce allowed directories,
'             handle large file sizes, avoid blocking UI thread.
'       - WebExtension core: request routing, minimal protocol, likely JSON/HTTP.
'       - Reviewer focus: validate no arbitrary file read/write, restrict external origin access,
'         ensure request size limits, avoid code injection via prompt content.
'
'   Resources
'       - Embedded assets: icons (ribbon), templates, prompt library defaults, language strings.
'       - Reviewer focus: check for hardcoded secrets, mutable resources used as dynamic prompts,
'         localization fallback behavior.
'
'   Ribbon1.vb (and Ribbon2 if present)
'       - UI layer: button click handlers calling MainMenu or helper methods (e.g., ShowSettings, HelpMeInky).
'       - Dynamic enable/disable based on config (INIloaded, GPTSetupError, selection context).
'       - Reviewer focus: ensure no long-running work on UI callbacks; all heavy LLM calls are async.
'
' EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (FOR REVIEW)
'   DiffPlex: text diff generation (verify unmodified usage, license Apache 2.0).
'   Markdig: Markdown → HTML conversion (pipeline configured with advanced extensions; review for XSS if HTML rendered in custom windows).
'   Newtonsoft.Json / Google Protobuf / gRPC libs: serialization / API calls (audit for external traffic).
'   HtmlAgilityPack: HTML parsing (ensure safe usage for user-controlled HTML).
'   Cryptography / Pdf libraries (BouncyCastle, PdfPig, PdfiumViewer): not directly shown here—confirm constrained usage.
'   Whisper.net / Vosk / NAudio: speech/transcription modules (check if loaded lazily; resource cleanup).
'   SharedLibrary.SharedMethods: central abstraction for LLM calls, config reading, UI dialogs; treat as trust boundary (audit separately).
'
' CONCURRENCY & THREADING
'   - UI thread affinity enforced via captured SynchronizationContext.
'   - Asynchronous Tasks for LLM requests; ConfigureAwait(False) used to prevent deadlocks.
'   - Interlocked guards (e.g., inMainMenu, delayedStartupOnce) prevent reentrancy.
'   - Timer-based OLE filter revocation to bound filter lifetime.
'
' SECURITY / REVIEW HOTSPOTS
'   1. Prompt Injection: Freestyle and user-supplied prompts are concatenated into system prompts—validate escaping where model calls depend on structured markup (<TEXTTOPROCESS> tags).
'   2. HTML / Markdown Rendering: Output into windows (ShowHTMLCustomMessageBox) → ensure no script execution (Markdig produces HTML; confirm viewer control neutralizes scripts).
'   3. File I/O: MyStyle prompt storage & prompt library reading—check path validation and absence of directory traversal.
'   4. HTTP Listener: Confirm authentication, port binding restrictions, and rejection of unsolicited external requests.
'   5. Clipboard: Large data insertion & RTF conversion—ensure size caps to avoid memory pressure.
'   6. COM Automation: Robust retry logic prevents crashes but could mask persistent failures—log repeated COMException patterns.
'   7. Alternate Models: When switching (2nd API / model selection), verify restoration of original config (RestoreDefaults) always succeeds.
'   8. Diff Cap (MarkupDiffCap): Performance safeguard—ensure enforced consistently for both Command_InsertAfter and Freestyle flows.
'
' QUICK TRACE POINTS
'   Startup path: ThisAddIn_Startup → (Explorer_Activate OR BeginInvoke DelayedStartupTasks) → InitializeConfig → UpdateHandler.PeriodicCheckForUpdates → StartupHttpListener.
'   Command flow (example): Ribbon click → MainMenu("Correct") → Command_InsertAfter(prompt...) → LLM() → (optional PostCorrection) → insertion + markup.

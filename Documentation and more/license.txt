The term "Red Ink" includes its documentation, the content of the installation package, and the source code, each as published by LawDigital Ltd. It does not include any third-party works. For any "chargeable use" (as defined in this license), you must also have a valid Red Ink license subscription agreement (the "Red Ink Subscription") with LawDigital Ltd. Your chargeable use of Red Ink will only be permitted and covered by the Red Ink Subscription (i) during the Red Ink Subscription's term, (ii) if you fully comply with and agree to be bound by it, (iii) once it has been fully paid, and (iv) only within the limits set forth in or agreed with LawDigital Ltd. with it (e.g., number of subscribed users and subscription period). The term "chargeable use" means any commercial or professional use and any use of Red Ink by a company, organization or other body, excluding (a) use for non-productive testing for up to six months per company, organization or body (starting upon the initial installation, and for up to five users), and (b) the use by a company, organization or other body for any number of users up to the end of January 2026, and in each case (a) and (b) if you have informed LawDigital Ltd. of your use by e-mail to info@redink.ai by providing your contact details (by doing so, you agree to be informed about further licensing options and related aspects). For any private, non-professional use that is not a chargeable use, this license is granted to you individually at no charge and royalty-free and limited in time to the three years following the official release date of the copy of Red Ink made available by LawDigital Ltd. and as also stated by such copy. Under any of the foregoing licenses, you may modify the source code of Red Ink and compile it for creating your own executable, only for your own purposes (but not to make available the resulting derivative works for use beyond your own entity and entities owned by you or under common control), provided you share all modifications and enhancements (except those that by their nature are to be used only by you internally, e.g., because they concern a company-specific use case or setup or contain pre-existing proprietary works unrelated to Red Ink), and fixes of defects to the original source code or other materials with LawDigital Ltd. and you hereby irrevocably grant LawDigital Ltd. the transferable, royalty-free and unlimited right to include such modifications, enhancements and fixes in future releases of Red Ink, including paid versions; the same also applies to any ideas, GitHub pull requests and other proposals for or in relation to Red Ink you share with LawDigital Ltd. or its representatives. Any other use is not permitted, and no ownership or title to any rights are assigned or transferred to you. Red Ink may not be used for purposes prohibited under applicable law or otherwise in a manner in violation of applicable law. It is neither made nor intended for high-risk use cases (including as per the EU AI Act), including any use case where failures or errors may affect the security or safety of people, systems or assets; if you use it for such use cases, you do so at your own risk and responsibility. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless LawDigital Ltd., VISCHER Ltd., David Rosenthal, their licensors (including, without limitation, Microsoft Corporation) from and against any claims, damages, or losses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use or distribution of Red Ink or your violation of these terms, law or third-party rights. If you violate this license, the copyright in Red Ink or the Red Ink Subscription (if in place), this license immediately terminates. This license is subject to the license conditions of the various libraries and other third-party works included in Red Ink or provided with it, which are listed in this document, in Red Ink or associated materials and apply accordingly. These third-party works are licensed to you by their licensors as per the respective licenses listed herein, in Red Ink or associated materials.

No warranty is made regarding the operation of Red Ink, its functionality or the information or results obtained through its use, or the impact it may have on your documents, data or system. The features of Red Ink presented or advertised may not be available with the model you use, or not perform as expected; you need to obtain your model(s) and other services to use Red Ink on your own, at your own cost and risk, and separately. Your use of Red Ink is at your own risk and your own cost. In no event, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall LawDigital Ltd., VISCHER Ltd., their officers, employees and agents and David Rosenthal be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, loss of data, or any other loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use Red Ink or otherwise in connection with Red Ink, even if LawDigital Ltd. or the other persons mentioned have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and irrespective of the legal basis for such claims. The foregoing exclusion of warranty and liability also applies in connection to any support, guidance or information that LawDigital Ltd., VISCHER Ltd. or David Rosenthal may provide you in connection with "Red Ink". You are required to comply with all national and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use (more information: www.microsoft.com/exporting).

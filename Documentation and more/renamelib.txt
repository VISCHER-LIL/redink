DateCommSenderRecipientTopic (yymmdd leading)|Extract (1) date (prefer explicit document date; else first date in content; else today) and format yymmdd. Then a space, then CommunicationType (Email, Letter, Memo, Call, MeetingNotes etc.), a space, SenderShortName, " to ", RecipientShortName, " - ", concise CamelCase Topic (remove filler words and punctuation). Sender/Recipient short names: first initial + surname without spaces (John Smith -> JSmith; Jane A. Doe -> JDoe). Topic: key nouns only (e.g. "Project Alpha deadline discussion" -> "ProjectAlphaDeadline"). If multiple candidates, choose most central topic (project, matter, or subject line). Use {OutputLanguage} for language-specific words if needed but keep structure. Do not exceed 80 characters total. Output only the filename body. Example original: "Email John Smith to Jane Doe re project alpha 12 March 2025.pdf" -> "250312 Email JSmith to JDoe - ProjectAlpha". If no date found use today. Avoid duplicate words, trim spaces, remove diacritics in names if necessary.

ExhibitOrOriginalPlusDescription|Start with the exact original filename body (e.g. "Exhibit 1", "DraftAgreement", "Annex B") unchanged (preserve spacing and capitalization, remove trailing extension if present). Then add " - " and a brief descriptive phrase (3–8 words) in {OutputLanguage} capturing the core subject/content (no dates unless critical, no matter codes). Use plain words (no CamelCase unless already in original), ASCII-safe characters (letters, numbers, spaces, hyphen, underscore). Avoid repeating words already in the original. Total length ≤ 80 characters. Output ONLY the final filename body (no extension, no quotes). Examples: Original "Exhibit 1" -> "Exhibit 1 - Share Purchase Timeline"; Original "Annex B" -> "Annex B - Supplier Pricing Overview"; Original "DraftAgreement" -> "DraftAgreement - Key Revisions Summary".

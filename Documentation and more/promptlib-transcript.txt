Interview (two people)|I have a raw transcript for you to process. Please note that the transcript is generated from an audio feed and may contain errors, incomplete sentences, missing punctuation, and other artifacts. If speaker labels are absent, detect speaker turns by changes in tone, content, or context, and assign consistent labels "Interviewer" and "Interviewee" (in bold). Read and analyze the entire transcript thoroughly before producing any text. Once you have fully understood the exchange, produce a formatted interview transcript with clear Q&A structure in markdown: prefix each line with Interviewer: or Interviewee:, correct any transcription errors, expand contractions or unclear fragments for readability, and include brief speaker bios at the top if names are known or placeholders if not. Ensure the dialogue flows naturally and the content is well-written. The LLM should automatically detect the language of the transcript and respond in the same language. The transcript is here:

Discussion (multiple speakers)|I have a raw transcript for you to process.

Once you have full understanding of the discussion, output a clean, readable dialogue in markdown: begin with a brief list of participants and their roles (if known), then present each speaker’s contributions in labeled paragraphs. Correct transcription errors, expand unclear fragments, and group short interjections or fillers into the preceding speaker’s dialogue. At the end, include a very brief summary of the overall consensus or main themes. Ensure the text is well-written and logically consistent.

If the source isn’t clear, omit it.\n   - Format each quote as a blockquote in markdown.\n4. **Anecdotes & Interesting Side Stories**\n   - Extract any brief anecdotes, humorous exchanges, surprising side comments, or memorable asides that could be used for small-talk or illustrative storytelling.\n   - Present each item as a short paragraph or bullet point, noting the speaker if known.\nImprove the text so that it is well written and logically consistent, compensating for any transcription errors.
